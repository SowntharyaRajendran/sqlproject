10. describe about left , right , inner , self , cross joins & unions , subquries

Left join: it is a keyword which returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
if there is no match then the result is NULL from the right side.

eg. SELECT students.studentName, passed_stu.pass_stu.no
FROM students
LEFT JOIN Orders ON students.studentName = passed_stu.studentName
ORDER BY students.studentName;


Right join: it is a keyword which returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
if there is no match then the result is NULL from the left side.

eg.SELECT students.studentName, passed_stu.pass_stu.no
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON students.studentName = passed_stu.studentName
ORDER BY students.studentName;


INNER JOIN: It Returns records that have matching values in both tables. 
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN : Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. 
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN : Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.

SELF JOIN: Itis used to join a table to itself i.e, each row in a table is joined to itself and every other row in that table.
CROSS JOIN: Also called CARTESIAN PRODUCT JOIN. It is used to combine each row of one table with each row of another table,
 and return the Cartesian product of the sets of rows from the tables that are joined.

UNIONS: It combines the results of two or more queries into a distinct single result
 set that includes all the rows that belong to all queries in the Union.
 In this operation, it combines two more queries and removes the duplicates.

eg. SELECT column1(s) FROM student1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1(s) FROM student2;

SUBQUERIES: subquery is a query that appears inside another query statement.
TYPES OF SUBQUERIES
1.Single-row subquery,
2.multiple row subquery, 
3.multiple column subquery, 
4.correlated subquery,  
5.nested subquery.
